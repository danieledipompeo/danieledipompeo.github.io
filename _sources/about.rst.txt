About Me
========

Welcome to my academic and research profile. I am a researcher and educator at the University of L'Aquila, Department of Engineering, Information Science, and Mathematics, specializing in **Software Performance Engineering** and **Search-Based Software Engineering**. My work focuses on developing innovative solutions for software quality assessment, performance optimization, and sustainable software architectures.

With over a decade of experience in software engineering research, I lead and participate in national and European research projects, supervise PhD students, and teach advanced programming methodologies. My research bridges the gap between theoretical computer science and practical software engineering challenges, particularly in emerging domains such as autonomous vehicles, microservices architectures, and energy-aware computing.

Current Research Focus
======================

My research centers on addressing the complex challenges of modern software systems, where multiple quality attributes must be optimized simultaneously. I am particularly interested in:

**Multi-Objective Software Architecture Optimization**

I develop and apply evolutionary algorithms, particularly NSGA-II, to automatically explore vast architectural solution spaces. My work demonstrates how to find optimal design alternatives that balance performance, reliability, sustainability, and architectural complexity. This research has shown improvements up to 42% in performance and 32% in reliability in generated model alternatives.

**Performance Engineering and Energy Awareness**

I investigate the relationship between software maintenance activities and their impact on system performance and energy consumption. My current work includes developing frameworks for automated performance testing in CI/CD pipelines and creating new catalogs of energy-related code smells. This research is particularly relevant in the context of sustainable computing and green software engineering.

**Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**

I lead research in model-based generation and optimization of ADAS testing scenarios in co-simulation environments. This work addresses the critical need for comprehensive validation methodologies in autonomous and connected vehicle systems, focusing on safety-critical requirements and system-of-systems integration.

Methodological Innovations
--------------------------

**Human-in-the-Loop Optimization**

I have pioneered preference-based interactive approaches to multi-objective software architecture optimization. This hybrid methodology allows software architects to guide the search process, leading to improved architectural quality within focused regions of the solution space while reducing computational time.
