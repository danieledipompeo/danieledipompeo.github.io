Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) play a crucial role for improving road safety, reducing traffic congestion, and decreasing fuel consumption, thus paving the way to safer and more environment-friendly mobility, which are key objectives of the Italian PNRR. 
Novel ADAS mostly rely on AI techniques to “understand” the current situation around the vehicle (e.g.: a pedestrian in front of the car), plan and execute appropriate behavior (e.g.: emergency braking).
